Here's a brief description of each folder and its purpose:

assets: Store static assets like images, fonts, and other media files.
components: Organize your React components into subdirectories based on their functionality or use cases.
context: Create context providers for global state management (e.g., user authentication, shopping cart).
pages: Define your page-level components here. Each page typically corresponds to a route in your application.
services: Implement API services and data fetching utilities. This is where you interact with your backend or external APIs.
styles: Store global styles and use CSS modules for component-specific styles.
utils: House utility functions that can be used throughout your application.
App.js: The main application component that ties everything together.
index.js: The entry point for your React app.
routes.js: Configuration for routing (e.g., using React Router).
config.js: Configuration settings, such as API endpoints or environment variables.
App.test.js: Tests for your main application component.
setupTests.js: Configuration for your testing environment.
